                Little Wishes is a youth-led initiative that introduces young children to a variety of topics and career fields through interactive and creative activities. Through fundraisers, we put together care bags for hospital patients, decorated by the children themselves to bring comfort and joy.

                Our mission is to educate and inspire children by exposing them to diverse fields while encouraging creativity and community involvement. By combining learning with hands-on service projects, Little Wishes creates meaningful experiences for both the kids who participate and the patients who receive our care bags.
